cs-correlated-noise
===================

This is a package of Matlab scripts to reproduce the results of the scientific paper "Compressed Sensing with Correlation Between Measurements and Noise".

The repo is empty so far, but the code will be uploaded in a few days when I have finished tidying it up.
